#  Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes using machine learning algorithms. It uses medical measurements such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age to make predictions.

The goal is to build an accurate, interpretable model that can support early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

## Dataset Information
- Source: [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
- Features include: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- Target: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)


## âœ… Results Summary
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 88%
- The model shows strong potential in assisting doctors with early diabetes detection.
